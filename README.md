# Flutter dice fight

This is a Flutter project that consists in a dice fight: the player that has the highest score (higher dice roll) wins!
This game is meant to be played on a pc window, running an android emulator won't work because the interface wasn't designed to handle android emulator.

The base for this project comes from rsanlazaro's repository flutter-roll_dice: https://github.com/rsanlazaro/flutter-roll_dice
